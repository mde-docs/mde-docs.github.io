Hi there! Welcome to MDE Docs.

Model Driven Engineering (MDE) is a methodology that primarily makes use of software models to carry out a software development process. Well-defined models are used to specify, validate, design, and implement complete software systems. Simply put, models undergo transformations to produce software. 

This website is meant to provide comprehensive documentation on MDE concepts, notations, process and rules, and tools for users of all skill levels. The main aim of this project is to introduce MDE to new users and provide extensive support for field experts in a clear format from a non-technical perspective. Another important objective is to document 3 projects of varying skill levels: a basic example for beginners, a complex example for improved understanding and an industry level project for expert use.

Model transformations lie at the core of MDE but it is only one of the tools used in the software development process. Tools that automate tasks such as model-to-text transformations, model comparison, model validation and merging are also required. Some of these tools, model transformation languages (MTLs) in particular, are documented within this website. Namely, [Epsilon Transformation Language (ETL)](etl.md) and [Yet Another Model Transformation Language (YAMTL)](yamtl.md) have been thoroughly described.

This site comprises of well-researched MDE concepts and tools that have not yet been widely adopted. After reading the docs, we hope the users see the benefit of automated code generation and syntactically well-defined programs that are applicable to a diverse range of use cases.
