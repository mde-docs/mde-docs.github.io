# MDE Docs Journal

This journal is a place to keep track of the progress of the MDE Docs project. 

## Issues

* [ ] [Issue #1](https://github.com/yamtl/examples/blob/master/FlowchartToHTML/src/main/groovy/flowchartToHtmlExamples/Transient.groovy) - Transient rules don't work as expected with/without the priority attribute.
* [ ] [Issue #2](https://github.com/yamtl/examples/blob/master/FlowchartToHTML/src/main/groovy/flowchartToHtmlExamples/ModuleComposition.groovy) - Module composition doesn't inherit properly thus no output is generated.
* [ ] [Issue #3](https://github.com/yamtl/examples/blob/master/FlowchartToHTML/src/test/groovy/flowchartToHtmlExamples/BaseTest.groovy) - Assertion errors are thrown because the expected output and generated output are not the same (even though syntactically they are the same).
* [ ] [Issue #4](https://github.com/mde-docs/mde-docs.github.io/blob/nafey/mde-docs-site/docs/tutorials/yamtl-flowchart-to-html.md) - The YAMTL tutorial is missing a hyperlink to the online Epsilon Playground (YAMTL needs to be set up in the online playground).

## Suggestions

* Use CI/CD to collaborate and test the code.
* Publish parts of the website to original documentation sites (i.e. Epsilon, ETL, YAMTL).
* Potentially introduce video content to the docs (e.g. for debugging or walkthroughs).

## Features Implemented

* [x] Landing page
* [x] General documentation for ETL and YAMTL
* [x] Linked List Reversal general example
* [X] ETL and YAMTL tutorials for the Linked List Reversal project
* [x] Flowchart to HTML general example
* [x] ETL and YAMTL tutorials for Flowchart to HTML project
* [x] Flowchart to HTML project embedded in the online Epsilon playground (only for ETL at the moment)
* [x] YAMTL variant with more examples of the original Flowchart to HTML project 
* [x] UI/UX improvements and usability features (e.g. search bar, navigation bar, dark mode, content timestamps, etc.)
