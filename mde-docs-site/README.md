The project directory structure is as follows:

* Markdown files ending with `.md` inside the `docs/` folder are the main content of the site. These are the landing page (`index.md`) and the MTL related pages (`etl.md`, `yamtl.md` and `epsilon.md`). **Note:** documentation for MTL tools can be found in the `Model Transformation Languages` section of the live website.

* `docs/assets` folder contains the external files embedded into the site like images and download files.

* `docs/examples` folder has the problem description pages for each of the documented examples. You can find different MTL solutions to each case within the example pages.

* `docs/tutorials` folder includes the MTL solutions (either in ETL or YAMTL) for all example cases. Each solution is explained thoroughly and the project setup is clearly stated. **Note:** these pages are referred within the example pages (`docs/examples`) so that the examples are documented in a case-solution format.
