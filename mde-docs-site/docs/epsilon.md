# Eclipse Epsilon

Epsilon is a family of scripting languages and tools for automating common model-based software engineering tasks such as code generation, model-to-model transformation, model validation and model visualisation, that work out of the box with EMF, UML, Simulink, XML and other types of models.

Epsilon can be used as a standard Java library, and also provides Apache Ant tasks that can be embedded in Maven/Gradle builds. Editing support for Epsilon programs is available in Eclipse, VS Code and Sublime.
